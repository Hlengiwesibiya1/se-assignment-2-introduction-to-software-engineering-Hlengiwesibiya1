Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

software engineering is a application in computer science used to deploy and maintain high quality software. It is the combining of different prograams to achieve one task. It is basically the background in the biilding of a software. It is a decipline where you come up with with simple computer software. It does that by designing, developing and maintaining a software product.

Traditional programming is more of a fixed programming and deals with code whereas software engineering is more broad as it involves stages from designing to the maintanace of a software. It enables the creation of the software and it has systems thta power many aspects of life such as communication, entertainment and health. Their software application improves the budget, quality and are time affective. Traditional programming on the other hand only approach is to create a certain instructions for a computer to follow. 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

SDLC
*REQUIRMENTS
It is the gathering and documentation of user problems and what is needed to design the solution to solve the problems.

*DESIGN
It is creating designs of the software architecture and user interface. The designs are of a high quality and very detailed. Examples of these are LOGGIN and MENU

*IMPLEMENTATION
It is the writting and building of the code to the specifications of the design. In order for the software to look exactly as in designs you'll need to write code that will assure the design comes out as intended.

*TESTING
In order to know the software is of high quality and functions perperly as intended, a bunch of tests need to be done.

*DEPLOYMENT
This is a phase where the software is set to be released to the customer/user. once it is tested and it works properly as it should , it is then trusted enough to be given to the public.

*MAINTENANCE
This is wgere support is given to the custorme for updates and enhancements of the software. this is done after the customer has been given the software for use.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall modules are a string approach with simila phases flowing down like a waterfall e.g SDLC. The phases are step by step and if one step is missed the waterfall stops so the project cannot continue or finish.

Agile modeules approach focusses more on flexability, collaboration and responding to change. With is module  one can focus on the last phase and come back and do the first phase of the project.You can basically do as you please.

The Scrum is the Agile framework that focusses on small, self organised teams that work repeatedly called sprints.

Waterfall modules are prefered for doing short programms.

Agile modules are prefered for doing long programms. 

Doing a long project on waterfall module would delay and slow the process and while you are taking time the user needs might change and maybe someone will finish before you.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING
These are the rules and responsibilities in software engineering. 

*SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
They are responsible for the writting of code and application of software solutions.

*QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
Ensures the quality of the software by carrying out test plans for the software.

*PROJECT MANAGER
Oversees the whole project running from the planninf, execution and delivering of the software.

*SYSTEM ARCHITECT
Designs the structure of the software system .

*UI/UX DESIGNER
Designs the user interface and user experience for the software application.

Each role is important for the development of a high quality software. They each contribute greatly to the different parts of the software from coding, testing, project management to the UI/UX Designing.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is a design principle that devides a system into smaller parts and those parts are called modules. It breaks the application down down into separate parts thus each module can be designed independently. each module gets it fully attention and is designed properly. The importance given to each gives definition between the modules.

*Advantages of modularity in software design 
with each module being designed independently ,all put together make a high lwvwl software as one is designed throughly.
It improves the design process by allowing better reusability, workload handling and easier debugging.
Their code is easier to use, test and debug.

Modularity in software design improves the maintainability and scalability of software system greatly because by breaking down the modules you can easily move , replace and fix a module without affecting the other modules or the software.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Testing is very crucial in software engineering as you need to know if the software is ready to use by the user. You want to know if it does not clash and also if it works as intended.

*UNIT TESTING
Software development process that focusses on individual components of software. This is when a block of code verifies a smaller but accurate block of code. Basically it is a specific code that verifies the accuracy of a small yet secluded code. e.g your car is locked but you cannot unlock it with your house keys or your neighbours car keys of the same model.

*INTERGRATED TESTING
This is usually the second step in software testing. This is when components of a software are placed together and then tested as a unified group. Unlike the Unit testing in this testing software can intergrate. This also tests if the the unit tested software works well together and cohensively. 

*SYSTEM TESTING
It is the testing of the overall fictionality and performance of the whole system

*ACCEPTANCE TESTING
Is a software testing that verifies if the system meets all of its functional and non-functional requirements before it is available for users.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version cotrol system also known as VCS are software tools that track the changes to cource code and coordinating work among a team members. It is a platform that helps exchange ideas with other developers. they are importand as the enable better management, tracking and implementation of change to code. They keep track of every modification made on the code on a special database. e.g Git and Subversions

*GIT
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in coding during software development.

*SUBVERSION
Is a centralised version control system that keeps track of every change users make on files and if anyone need to change code they can access those files.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A software project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivering of a software project. They also control the goals, progress and day to day of the project. 

Some examples include
*COMMUNICATION
Poor communication amongst the team members can be very challenging for the manager and misunderstandings and misinformation as well.

*LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY
All team members have a role to play and if a member does not excute their part it makes it difficult to finish the project. A member needs to be accountable if they do not do their part

*SCOPE CREEP
Projects will get out of control if stakeholders or customers do not know what they want as they frequently request new stuff which will delay the project and couse the manager fustrations.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is providing updates and enhancements on a software to keep up with new customer need. I t is done after the software has been handed over to the customer. It is essential as the needs of the user might extend and proviging maintenance helps keep the user satisfies with the software.

different types of software maintenanceare corrective, adaptive, perfective and preventitive software maintanence.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

The ethical software engineering are 

*RESPECTING THE USER PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY
The upholding of user privacy and data security is one of the most crucial ethical factors in software engineering. It is the duty of the developer to respect and protect the private data of their user as the information is personal.

*MITIGATING BIAS DESCRIMINATION
Make sure the algorythms are not biased and push a certain narrative. Our interractions with technology are shaped by algorythms so it is important that developers are not biased in setting up algorythm.

*ENSURING ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION
The developer must make sure to give access to all users, particularly those with impaiments and of a disadvantage background. Developers should always keep accessability in mind as its one of the ethical aspects

*PROMOTING ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES
It is important for developers to consider how their work will affect society and the environment.
